## Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The Corner Grocer requires a software solution to examine the textual data generated during daily operations. The program solves this problem by providing the frequency of items purchased daily. 

## What did you do particularly well?
The structure of the program was well organized. The program is well documented. There is thorough error handling.

## Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I could focus on optimizing algorithms, minimizing unnecessary operations, and use suitable data structures for efficiency.

## Which pieces of the code did you find the most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
Reading data from a file and writing data to a file was the most challenging aspect for me because it was a fairly new concept. I utilized my CS210 class resources to ensure that every step when working with files was performed correctly. 

## What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or coursework?
Learning how to write well-structured code, error handling, and documentation.

## How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Applied the DRY principle to create more maintainable code. Applied the SRP principle to ensure readability for each class and function. The majority of the program logic exists in the GroceryTracker class, allowing for adaptability in adding or improving features without making changes to the main file.
